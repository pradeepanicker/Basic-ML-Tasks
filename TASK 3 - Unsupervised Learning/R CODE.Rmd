# scaling data set to attain uniformity in variable data definition. This is since 
# clustering is done with calculating the distance of different data points to each other.
# If the data value is not scaled to UNIFORMITY [ for eg. - One column has data in the rage of 1 ~ 10 and the next     
# column has data in the range of 0 ~ 1] the distance calculated between the points of such two coloumns/ variables will # be FALSE-LEADING for statistical measures.

# Two types of Clustering exist - (1) HIRARCHIAL Clustering & (2) K-Means CLUSTERING

# HIRARCHIAL Clustering -
# Euclidean Distance measuring between data points is the method adopted in Hirarchial Clustering. Since this method adapts calculation on distance usually this method is ustilised for clustering small data - MAXIMUM 500 Rows/ Observations.

#First we generate the distrance matrix for the data set-

d.euclidean= dist(x= Iris4[,1:4], method = 'euclidean')
print(d.euclidean, digits=3)

# The Clustering is Formed based on the Distance Matrix created and a Dendrogram is plotted identifying the cluster tree -

irishclust= hclust(d.euclidean, method = 'average')
plot(irishclust, labels = as.character(Iris4[,6]))

#Now we cut the cluster dendrogram into THREE CLUSTERS - whhich is identified with RED Rectangular borders -

plot(irishclust, labels = as.character(Iris4[,6]))
rect.hclust(irishclust, k=3, border = 'red')

# Profiling of Clusters / Attache the generated clusters with the NAME in the data -

Iris4= cbind(Iris4, Iris[,c(6)])

# Create a vector with called 'groups' which has identifed 150 observations into Cluster groups by numbers -

groups= cutree(irishclust, k=3)

#create new dataset by joining the basic dataset with the coloumn identifying each row to each cluster -

Iris5= cbind(Iris,groups)

# Dataset is aggregates w.r.t. cluster identification number -

aggrIris= aggregate(Iris5[,c(2:5)],list(Iris5$groups),mean)
head(aggrIris)

# Tabulated form of cluster , tabulated w.r.t. the mean value of each variable.

clus.profiling= data.frame(Group= aggrIris[,1],Freq= as.vector(table(Iris5$groups)),aggrIris[-1])

# Clusters , if analysed, here is formed based on the SIZE of the FLOWER. 
#Cluster 1 is with the SMALLEST FLOWER - FIFTY IN Numbers - Smallest Petal Length & Sepal Length
# CLuster 2 is the MEDIUM SIZED FLOWER - NINTY SEVEN in Numbers - PETAL Length & Sepal Length larger than the smallest one.
# Cluster 3 has the LARGEST FLOWERS of the complete 150 Flowers - THREE NUMBERS - having PETAL Length and SEPAL Length to its maximum.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
